<!--

Summary:
	This file contains the id mappings used for blaze game reporting and stats, value "1" is reserved in each category
	as a fallback option in case the requested entity is not found (i.e. we add a new map but it hasn't made it into this
	file yet).

Limits:
	Limits are set on the blaze servers and require a config change to update, please talk to Colin when doing this.
	Current limits are 1->12 for gamemodes, 1->20 for maps, 1->35 for weapons and 1-22 for perks, 1-16 for damage types.

Best practices:
	It is nicer not to modify values of entities already in this mapping, since blaze has no idea what any of them mean
	it will happily return your previous SCAR stats when you're expecting Grendel stats, if the file ends up as a mess we
	can tidy it up all at once at a suitable point - i.e. when everyone is expecting it!  Removing old entries is fine and
	using entries that previously belonged to something that no longer exists is ok so long as you realise there may be
	some stray stats in the database for it.
