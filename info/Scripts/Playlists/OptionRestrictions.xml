	<!-- 
		Option Restrictions are limitations placed on the cvars found inside the custom variant options

		Each restriction node consists of two conditions, these are both checked whenever either of the 
		cvars involved are modified, if both conditions return true then the cvar that has NOT just been
		modified is set to it's fallback value.
		
		For instance if we have this :
			<Restriction>
				<Operand var="g_autoReviveTime" lessThan="7" fallback="7" />
				<Operand var="g_modevarivar_disableKillCam" equal="0" fallback="1" />
			</Restriction>
		and we set g_autoReviveTime to 3 while g_modevarivar_disableKillCam=0, both conditions now return
		true, since we're in the process of modifying g_autoReviveTime we change g_modevarivar_disableKillCam
		to it's fallback value of 1.  If we then decide to change g_modevarivar_disableKillCam back to 0
		then this time g_autoReviveTime will be set to 7.  This allows players to always set whatever option
		they want, we just sanity check and correct the other values as required to accommodate it

		Possible comparison types are:
			equal					var	== value
			notEqual			var != value
			lessThan			var < value
			greaterThan		var > value

		<!-- With a revive time less than 7, we don't have time to play the killcam -->
		<Operand var="g_autoReviveTime" lessThan="7" fallback="7" />
		<Operand var="g_modevarivar_disableKillCam" equal="0" fallback="1" />
	</Restriction>
